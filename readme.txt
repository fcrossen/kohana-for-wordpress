== Description ==

Kohana for WordPress is a wordpress plugin that allows you to integrate 
simple or complex PHP applications that use the Kohana 3.0 architecture 
with a wordpress site. 

Plugin provides your wordpress site with the following features

* Establishes a page which performs as a Kohana front loader
* Provides a Kohana Widget which turns any Kohana request into a WordPress Widget
* Provides a template function which loads any Kohana request into template files

For PHP developers who like working with MVC patterns, PHP5, OOP, and have the need
to build Wordpress plugins then Kohana-for-Wordpress lets you bring the two frameworks
together. You get the flexibility of providing end users with the Wordpress experience
of maintaining a web site and the backend power of Kohana.
